      "AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a broad field of computer science dedicated to creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  These tasks include things like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.\n",
      "* **Reasoning:** Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions.\n",
      "* **Problem-solving:** Finding solutions to complex situations.\n",
      "* **Perception:** Interpreting sensory information like images, sound, and text.\n",
      "* **Language understanding:** Processing and generating human language.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different approaches to AI, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Narrow or Weak AI:**  Designed for a specific task, like playing chess or recommending products.  This is the most common type of AI we see today.  Examples include Siri, Alexa, and spam filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **General or Strong AI:** Hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence and the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can.  This type of AI does not yet exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Super AI:** Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects. This is also purely theoretical at this point.\n",

      "It's important to note that the term \"AI\" is often used loosely, and many systems labeled as AI might only employ relatively simple algorithms.  True artificial general intelligence remains a significant scientific challenge.\n",
