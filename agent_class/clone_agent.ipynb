      "    *   **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  Algorithms are trained on datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions.  Different types of machine learning include:\n",
      "        *   **Supervised Learning:**  Training a model on labeled data (data with known outcomes).  For example, training a model to identify pictures of cats using a dataset of images labeled as \"cat\" or \"not cat.\"\n",
      "        *   **Unsupervised Learning:** Training a model on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures.  For example, clustering customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior.\n",
      "        *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Training a model to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward.  For example, training a robot to navigate a maze by rewarding it for moving closer to the goal and penalizing it for hitting walls.\n",
      "    *   **Deep Learning (DL):** A subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to analyze data with complex patterns. Deep learning is particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",
