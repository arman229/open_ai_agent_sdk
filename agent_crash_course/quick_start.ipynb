      "*   **Karachi (1947-1958):** When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, Karachi was its first capital. Karachi was a major port city and a commercial hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rawalpindi (Interim capital in the 1960s):** As Islamabad was being built, Rawalpindi served as a temporary capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Islamabad (1960s-Present):** The decision to move the capital to Islamabad was made for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Geographic location:** Islamabad is located in the north of the country, closer to the military headquarters and away from the coast (which made Karachi vulnerable).\n",
      "    *   **Neutrality:** The government wanted to establish a capital that was not associated with any particular ethnic or regional group, as Karachi was predominantly associated with the Urdu-speaking population that migrated from India.\n",
      "    *   **Planned city:** Islamabad was a purpose-built city, designed with modern infrastructure and administrative buildings.\n",
