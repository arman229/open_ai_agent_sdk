    "    \"   - If the customer says they ordered size 10 but the order has size 7 or 9 → it's invalid.\\n\"\n",
    "    \"   - If the customer says they ordered 10 items, but the order data shows they only ordered 2 — not received 2, but ordered 2 — then the complaint is invalid.\\n\"\n",
    "    \"   - Only declare it valid if **all the issues mentioned** clearly exist in the order data.\\n\"\n",
    "    \"3. Do not make assumptions, and never be lenient. Follow the facts.\\n\\n\"\n",

    "    \"- Complaint before delivery date → invalid.\\n\"\n",
    "    \"- Everything matches complaint → valid.\\n\\n\"\n",
