      "\n",
      "**علامہ اقبال ہمارے قومی شاعر ہیں۔**\n",

      "→ Generated Story:\n",
      " The cool morning air, thick with the scent of jasmine from the nearby garden, ruffled the pages of old Fatima's Quran. She sat on the worn charpai in her courtyard, the sunlight painting dappled patterns on the mud walls. Inside, her grandson, young Imran, wrestled with his Urdu homework.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nani Amma,\" Imran groaned, his voice muffled by the textbook, \"I just don't understand why we have to learn this *again*.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatima, her eyes twinkling with a life lived fully and lovingly, lowered her Quran slightly. \"What troubles you, beta?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This sentence, Nani Amma! **علامہ اقبال ہمارے قومی شاعر ہیں۔** (Allama Iqbal hamare qaumi shayar hain.) Allama Iqbal is our national poet. I know, I know! But it feels...distant. Like something just in a textbook.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatima smiled. She understood. Iqbal wasn't just a sentence to be memorized. He was the soul of their nation, a flame that had ignited hope in a dark time.\n",
      "\n",
      "She closed her Quran, the soft thud echoing in the quiet courtyard. \"Come here, Imran.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He scrambled out, his face etched with youthful frustration. Fatima patted the charpai beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see this jasmine, Imran?\" she asked, pointing to a particularly vibrant cluster blooming near the courtyard wall. \"It smells sweet, doesn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Imran nodded, inhaling deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Iqbal’s words are like this jasmine, Imran. They may seem simple at first, but when you truly understand them, their fragrance fills your heart and your soul. He didn’t just write pretty words. He wrote about our identity, our pride, our dreams for the future.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatima recounted stories she had heard from her own grandfather, of how Iqbal’s poetry had stirred the hearts of Muslims across the subcontinent. She spoke of his vision for a separate nation, a place where they could practice their faith and live with dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He spoke of the **'Khudi'**, Imran,\" she continued, her voice filled with reverence. \"He taught us to believe in ourselves, to find our inner strength, to strive for excellence. He said we should be eagles, soaring high above the limitations others impose upon us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She recited a few verses from \"Lab Pe Aati Hai Dua Ban Ke Tamanna Meri,\" her voice wavering slightly with age but filled with the emotion of the prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imran, listening intently, saw Iqbal’s words in a new light. He wasn’t just a poet; he was a voice, a guide, a beacon of hope. He understood now that **\"علامہ اقبال ہمارے قومی شاعر ہیں۔\"** (Allama Iqbal hamare qaumi shayar hain.) wasn't just a sentence; it was a declaration, a statement of belonging, a connection to the rich tapestry of his nation’s history.\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked up a fallen jasmine blossom, its petals soft against his palm. He looked at his Nani Amma, her eyes filled with wisdom and love.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Nani Amma,\" he said, finally understanding. \"Now I understand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned to his textbook, the sentence no longer feeling distant. It felt like home. It felt like hope. It felt like the sweet fragrance of jasmine filling the air on a warm morning. It felt like Iqbal's words, forever etched in the heart of a nation.\n",
