      " The old clock chimed four, a mournful sound that echoed through the dust-laden halls of the Government Boys High School. Outside, the relentless Lahore sun beat down, turning the air thick and heavy. Inside, young Ahmed, all of ten years, shifted nervously on his worn wooden stool. Today was the inter-school Urdu calligraphy competition, and the phrase ringing in his ears was: **علامہ اقبال ہمارے قومی شاعر ہیں۔** (Allama Iqbal hamare qaumi shayar hain.) – Allama Iqbal is our national poet.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wasn't nervous about the writing itself. Ahmed loved Urdu. He loved the graceful curves of the letters, the way they flowed together like a whispered secret. He practiced tirelessly, copying verses from Iqbal's poems into his tattered notebook, the ink staining his fingertips a permanent shade of blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, his fear stemmed from something else. Ahmed’s family, displaced after the Partition, eked out a meagre existence selling chai from a small cart near the Badshahi Mosque. Iqbal, the poet-philosopher who dreamed of a separate homeland, felt deeply personal to Ahmed. Iqbal wasn’t just a figure in a textbook; he was a guiding light, a voice that spoke of hope and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dipped his reed pen into the ink, the rich black liquid gleaming like polished onyx. He took a deep breath, the familiar scent of ink grounding him. The other students, some older and more experienced, were already engrossed in their work, their brows furrowed in concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahmed closed his eyes for a moment, picturing Iqbal's face - wise, compassionate, etched with the weight of his vision. He thought of his grandfather, who used to recite Iqbal's verses late into the night, his voice trembling with emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly, deliberately, he began to write. Each letter was a prayer, each stroke a testament to his love for the language and the man. The *alif* stood tall and proud, the *ain* curved like a gentle smile, the *laam* flowed like a river of dreams. He meticulously crafted the *qaaf*, the *waao*, the *meem*, pouring his heart and soul into each flourish.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he finished the last letter, a wave of exhaustion washed over him. He looked at his work, a simple sentence rendered with careful grace. It wasn't perfect. His hand trembled slightly, and a tiny ink blot marred the pristine white paper. But it was honest. It was his.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the judges finally announced the results, Ahmed didn't win. A boy from a more prestigious school, with finer paper and a steadier hand, took first prize. Disappointment pricked at Ahmed’s eyes, but it was quickly replaced by a quiet sense of pride. He had honored the poet, the language, and the memory of his grandfather.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, as he walked home through the crowded streets of Lahore, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of orange and gold, Ahmed whispered to himself, **علامہ اقبال ہمارے قومی شاعر ہیں۔** He knew, in his heart, that even without a prize, he had expressed something profound, something that resonated with the spirit of Iqbal himself: the unwavering belief in the power of words, the importance of heritage, and the enduring strength of the human spirit. He was just a young boy, but he understood that sometimes, the greatest rewards are not the ones you win, but the ones you earn within yourself.\n",
